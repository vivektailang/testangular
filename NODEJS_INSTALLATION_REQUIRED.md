# 🚀 IMPORTANT: Node.js Installation Required

## Current Status
The Angular MyShop application has been **fully created and configured**, but **Node.js is not yet installed** on your system.

## ⚠️ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Install Node.js Manually

Since the automated installation failed due to permissions, please install Node.js manually:

1. **Download Node.js**
   - Visit: https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version (v20.x or latest)
   - Click the Windows Installer (.msi)

2. **Run the Installer**
   - Run the downloaded `.msi` file
   - Click "Next" through the setup
   - Accept default settings
   - Click "Install"
   - Finish and **restart your computer** or terminal

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Open PowerShell/Command Prompt
   - Run: `node --version`
   - Run: `npm --version`
   - You should see version numbers

### Step 2: Run the Application

Once Node.js is installed:

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to project
cd e:\OffViv\PT_Codes\GitTesting\testangular

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the application
npm start
```

The browser will automatically open at **http://localhost:4200/**
